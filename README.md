<p align="center">
The fastest way to rename layers in Figma.<br>
No double-clicks. No dialogs. Just type.
</p>

<br>

## Quick Mode

Select any layer and start typing. The name updates instantly as you type, no save button needed. Works with multiple layers too.

Press Tab to jump to the next sibling layer, or Shift Tab to go back. Press Enter to dive into a frame and select its children. Click the layer icon to zoom straight to your selection.

<br>

## Advanced Mode

When you need to rename many layers at once, switch to Advanced Mode. Your layers appear in a spreadsheet-style grid where each column becomes part of the final name.

<br>

The plugin automatically parses your existing layer names, splitting them by separators like underscores, hyphens, and camelCase. Choose how layers are sorted with the direction picker, either by reading order or spatial position.

<br>

Select cells and drag the corner handle to fill a sequence. Numbers continue as 1, 2, 3. Letters continue as A, B, C. The preview column shows exactly what each layer will be named before you apply.

Turn on Track mode to automatically zoom to each layer as you navigate through the grid.
